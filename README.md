# TitanicKaggleProject

I decided to participate in this Kaggle competition as a way to get practice with machine learning techniques. I cleaned the data to remove NaNs for variables I needed to use, created visuals to see how variables performed when plotted against survival, and created a model to predict if a passenger would survive based on key variables. I decided to use a decision trees model for this, and when I submitted it to Kaggle, I recieved a 74% accuracy.
